# yuyuko.vim-vsc

A Vscode color theme

This is the vscode version for [yuyuko.vim](https://github.com/hylwxqwq/yuyuko.vim)

Now I didn't add it to Vscode's marketplace, will add later.

## To-Do

- [ ] Change the json, make it more like the yuyuko.vim.
- [ ] Monaco support.
- [ ] Publish to marketplace for vscode.
